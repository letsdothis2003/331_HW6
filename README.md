This is homework 6 for CSCI 331. We provided every file we worked on, separated per person except the GANTT chart and TODO list, which every member each adhered to.
Our leader, Yousuf, helped with direction(using the chart and list along with frequent communication) along with submission of this assignment. 
We went over chapter 6 which is set operators along with preceding knowledge from past chapters to implement propositions and queries while justifying why 
they make sense from a practical or bussiness perspective.
